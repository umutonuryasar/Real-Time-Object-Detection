# Real-Time Object Detection

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. It allows you to perform object detection on a video file and draw bounding boxes around detected objects with their class labels and confidence scores.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/umutonuryasar/Real-Time-Object-Detection.git
   cd Real-Time-Object-Detection

2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Make sure you have your video file (sample_video.mp4) and class names file (classes.txt) in the data/ directory. You can customize these files as needed.

2. Run the object detection script from the project root:
    
    ```bash
    python main.py

3. The object detection results will be displayed in a 'Object Detection' window. Press 'q' to exit the application.
